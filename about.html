    </div>

    <div class="body3">
        <div class="container1"><h5>Where I'm From:</h5>
            <p>I'm from Asheville, North Carolina. Whenever I get a chance to go back there, I really enjoy spending time outdoors hiking, mountain biking, and trail running. Growing up surrounded by the Blue Ridge Parkway instilled me with gratitude for beauty in nature and a passion for sustainability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container2"><h5>What I've Done:</h5>
            <p>I did ballet for 13 years, and 6 of those years I was training preprofessionally. While I no longer dance, I attribute my pursuit of pottery and deep appreciation for the arts to my roots in ballet, and am very grateful for that time in my life.</p></div>
        <div class="container2"><h5>Reasons for Current Interests:</h5>
            <p>I find my roots to have largely influenced my interests. I am presently quite interested in pursuing UX Design and Research because the thinking and skill sets involved bring together all of my interests; a big picture understanding of system flows, technical understandings, driven curiousity and problem solving all work together.</p></div>
        <div class="container3"><h5>Current Academics:</h5>
            <p>In studying Public Policy, I'm cultivating skills in research as well as literary analysis and synthesis. In studying Computer Science, I am expanding my technical skills on an increasingly popular platform. Together, the big picture and technical skills enable me to understand and collaborate more efficiently.</p>        </div>
        <div class="container4"><h5>Continuation of Arts and Sustainability Interests</h5>
            <p>Further, minoring in studio arts has enabled me to better create and synthesize visual information, and the creativity and depth of information conveyed through works continues to be a source of inspiration and anchor to my core values.</p></div>
        <div class="container1"><h5>Experience Informing Pursuits</h5>
            <P>Most recently, the opportunity to intern with 8x8 has inspired my curiousity and eagerness to pursue UX Design and Research. Through practical experience I have been able to incorporate artistic creativity into what originated as academic pursuits, further aligning with my interests and core values. </p>
